# **THE AGILE SAMURAI**

_Master Story List_ – contains high-level features (user stories). It is prioritized by the product owner, estimated but the development team, and forms the basis of a project plan.

_Sprint_ – is a one- to two-week period where you take the customers’ most important stories and transform them into running, tested software.

_Team Velocity_ – is how much the team can get done per one iteration.

## **Accepting 3 simple truths:**

1. It is impossible to gather all the requirements at the beginning of the project.
2. Whatever requirements you do gather are guaranteed to change.
3. There will always be more to do than time and money will allow

## **What makes great agile teams:**

- Co-Locaion

  - Engaged Customers
  - Self-Organizing
  - Let them create a plan, come up with the estimates, and the take ownership of the project

- Worry less about titles and roles and become more interested in seeing the continuous production of working tested software.
- Look for people who can take initiative, like being the masters of their own destiny, and don’t sit back and wait for orders.
- Accountable and Empowered.
- Make the team test the software in front of the customers.
- Not everyone needs to be empowered.
- Cross-functionality

# Agile Roles — DREAM TEAM

_Product Owner_ – decides what software does, what it looks like, and how it works, and who’s committed to guiding the team, answering questions, and giving feedback. It sets priorities from the business point of view.

_Development Team_ – is a cross-functional group of people who can take any feature the product owner would like developed and turned into production-ready, working software.

- Analyst

  - helps writing user stories
  - does the detailed analysis
  - makes sure the homework gets done (mock-ups, prototypes)
  - communicates the essence of the story

- Programmer

  - turns user stories into the working software
  - estimating with the rest of the team
  - makes technical decisions (tool/architecture, design, development practices)
  - write lots of tests to drive their designs
  - continuously designing and improving the architecture
  - making sure the codebase is always in a state of production readiness

- Tester

  - helps write tests for upcoming stories
  - confirms stories work as expected
  - thinks about the big testing picture

- Project Manager

  - tracking the progress
  - communicating the state of the project
  - removing roadblocks standing in the way (workspace, licensing, hardware)
  - planing, re-planing, and adjusting course when necessary

- UX Designer

> _There are also many other important roles: technical writers, trainers, business improvement, infrastructure, and networking. One of the most important principles to adapt is hiring people who are (1) generalists and (2) comfortable with ambiguity._

# Agile Project Inception — INCEPTION DECK

## **Asking 10 fundamental questions before starting any project:**

1. Why are we here

   - make better, more informed decisions
   - do a better job of balancing conflicting forces and trade-offs
   - come up with better, more innovative solutions as a result of empowerment
   - go and see for yourself
   - discover the intent (overarching vision)

2. Creating an Elevator Pitch
   - **For** the cannabis and hemp professionals
   - **Who** exchange offers on a daily basis
   - **The CANAbY App**
   - **Is a** peer-to-peer communications network
   - **That** allows for sharing product-specific notes and offers
   - **Without having to** juggle between Asana, Signal, and Excel
   - **Our product** boosts productivity by allowing users to organize and share offers that ultimately turn into deals.

> _Bring clarity, think about the customer, get to the point._

3.  Design a Product Box

    - Product’s benefits (features —> benefits)
    - Create a slogan (make information reliable again)
    - Design the box (name + slogan, pics, benefits)

            |_________________________________|/


4.  Create a NOT List

    - in scope
    - out of scope
    - unresolved

5.  Meet your neighbors
    - Legal
    - Technical writers
    - Training group
    - Help desk
    - Infrastructure
    - Security
    - Production support
    - Safety officers
    - Risk and compliance

> _Start by asking how does it work and keep in mind that the project’s community is always bigger than you think it is._

6. Show the solution

   Talking about the solution and getting it out in front of the team members and customers will help set expectations around tools and technology. This also allows us to visualize assumptions around project boundaries and scope and communicates risk.

7. Ask what keeps us up at night

   - write everything down that can go wrong
   - think really hard about how to stop those things from happening
   - then tear it up (fuhh-get it buddy!)

8. Size it up

   - think small (break down large projects to 3-6 month intervals)
   - set some expectations about the size and time of deliverables

9. Be clear on what’s going to give

   Budgets and dates tend to be fixed. Scope regularly seems to increase with reckless abandon. Quality is always #1.

   - The Furious Four:

     - Time
     - Budget
     - Quality
     - Scope

   - Be flexible, set expectations
   - They can’t all be #1
   - No two can occupy the same level
   - List the intangibles and/or trade-offs

10. Show what’s going to take

    - Assemble the A-team

      - Designer
      - PM
      - Developer(s)
      - Analyst
      - Product Owner
      - Tester

    - Clarify who’s calling the shots
    - Estimate how much it’s going to cost
    - Bring it all together

# Agile Project Documentation — USER STORY

Do not write complex documentation because the feature will always change. Instead, try creating _User Stories_ that can be broken down into the smaller cards, analyzed, prioritized, etc. The most efficient way of conveying information to and within a development team is a face-to-face conversation.

_User Story_ – is a short description of features the _product owner_ would like to one day see in their software. They are usually written on a card and are there to encourage to talk to customers.

    As a <type of user> who … is this story for
    I want <some goal> what … they want to do
    so that <some reason> why … they want to do it

## **Elements of Good User Stories:**

- The value proposition in simple terms
- End-to-end slicing through all layer of architecture

        I-ndependence
        N-egotiability
        V-alue
        E-stimable (3 days—2 weeks)
        S-mall
        T-estability

- Lean, accurate, just-in-time
- Encourage face-to-face communication
- Simplify planning
- Cheap, fast, easy to create
- Never out-of-date
- Based on the latest learnings
- Enable real-time feedback
- Avoid false sense fo accuracy
- Also for team-based collaboration and innovation

## **Story-Gathering Workshop**

_Story-Gathering Workshop_ – is a venue for the development team and product owner to get together and write _user stories_ about the system they would like to build. The goal of a workshop is breadth.

- Users (personas)
- Flowcharts
- Scenarios
- System maps
- Process flows
- Concept designs
- Storyboards
- Prototypes
- Other

_Constraints_ – are characteristics the _product owner_ would like to see in the software (super-fast app, designs should look good). They aren’t the typical user story that can be delivered in a week, however, it can be broken down to smaller cards with user stories.

_Epics_ – big stories that take a couple of weeks of work (high-level planning).

# The Fine Art of Guessing — ESTIMATION

The primary purpose of software estimation is not to predict a project’s outcome; it is to determine whether a project’s target is realistic enough to allow the project to be controlled to meet them. Estimating allows to plan for the future, reminds that our estimates are guesses, and acknowledges the inherent complexities of creating software.

_Relative Sizing_ – sizing the user stories relative to each other and measuring the velocity.

Point-Based System enables us to track progress and estimate relatively without having to worry about how actuals compared to our estimates. We are trying to capture the bigness of a task with a number and size relative to all others.

**Triangulation:**

- Logical Groupings
- Stories that go end-to-end (flesh out the architecture)
- Anything typical throughout the project

_Spike_ – is a time-boxed experiment where we do just enough investigation to come up with an estimate and then stop (no user story created).

_Planning Poker_ – is a game where the development team estimates the stories individually first and then compares the results collectively together after.

# Dealing with Reality — PLANNING

## **Agile Plan Features:**

- Delivers great value to customers
- Is highly visible
- Lets us make promises we can keep
- Enables to adapt and change the plan when necessary

> _Treating initial plans as hard commitments is what kills projects before they’ve even started. Being flexible around scope is how agile projects maintain the integrity of plans. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development. Agile process harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage._

_Release_ – a logical grouping of stories that make sense to the customer, i.e. something worth bundling up and deploying (MMF).

_Burn-Down Chart_

- How much work has been done
- How much work remains
- The team’s velocity
- Expected completion date

_Burn-Up Chart_

- Presents the discovery of new stories

## Steps to Create an Agile Plan:

1. Create a Master Story List
2. Size It Up
3. Prioritize
4. Estimate Team Velocity

   `Iterations = Total Effort ÷ Estimated Team Velocity`

   `Team Velocity = Stories Completed ÷ Iteration`

   `Team Velocity = Story Pts Completed ÷ Iteration`

5. Pick Dates
   - Deliver by Date
   - Deliver by Feature Set

# Iteration Management – MAKE IT HAPPEN

## How to Deliver Something of Value Every Week

Do the light and acurate analysys, without writing things down. Make sure the development practices are rock-solid. It has to work out of the gate. That means well-designed, well-tested, completely integrated code as you go. And finally, testing has to be lockstep with development.

## The Agile Iteration

- ### Preparation

  There are two types of analysis: _just-enough_, and _just-in-time_. Use small cards for little tasks, one-pagers for medium-sized, and summaries for heavier projects.

  **Story Name:** Create Transportation Manifest.

  **Description:** Before distributors can legally turn the offer into a sale, they need a manifest. This manifest contains the information necessary to validate the transaction by providing enough information for the METRC®.

  **Tasks**

        1. Create manifest page.
        2. Choose the required fields.
        3. Save manifest to database.
        4. Add basic validation.

  **Test Criteria**

        1. Requester can save basic manifest.
        2. Manifest gets saved to the database.
        3. Invalid manifests are rejected.
        4. Manifest defaults to the today's time and date.

_Just-in-time_ analysis is about the deep-dive analysis on the user story just before you need it (usually the iteration before). Flow charts are used for this sort of planning and analysis.

- Analysis gets done with the latest and greatest information.
- You and product owner give yourslef a chance to learn and innovate as you go.
- You avoid having to do a lot of rework.

_Personas_ – are simple descriptions or stereotypes for the roles different people will play when they use your sfotware.

> _Try different designs fast using paper prototypes. Then, define success by writing some acceptable tests._

- ### Development
  - Write automated tests.
  - Continuously evolve and improve our designs.
  - Continuously integrate our code to produce working software
  - Make sure code matches the language our customers use when they talk about the system.
- ### Testing
  - a/b testing
  - peer review
  - testing against story user story criteria

## KANBAN

Kanban is limited by a concept called _work in progress_ (WIP). A team is only allowed to work on a finite things at once. The goal of Kanban is flow. Move things accotss the board as quickly as you can by working on only few things at once.

**Advantages:**

- You don't get stressed about iteraions.
- You are not limited to taking on tasks that fit within a single iteraion.
- It's a nice way to manage expectations.

# Creating an Agile Plan – COMMUNICATIONS

**Four things to Do During Any Iteration**

- Make sure next iteration's work is ready (story-planning meeting).
- Get feedback on las iteration's stories (showcase).
- Plan the next iteration's work (iteation planning meeting).
- Continuously look for areas of improvement (mini-retrospective).

## The Stoty-Planning Meeting

This is a _just-in-time_ analysis checkpoint meeting. During the SPM, review test criteria with the product owner, review estimates with developers, and make preparations for the next batch of iteration stories.

## The Showcase

During this stage you and the team demo last iteraion's stories. Showing real live code delpoyed on the test server. It's the stuuf that can be deployed.

## Pland the Next Iteration

The iteraion planning meeting (IPM)--is where you get together with the product owner and plan the next iteration's work, review the teams velocity, review upcoming stories, and figure out the scope of commit for the next iteraion. Also, IPMs are great to do a mini-healthcheck. Always ask if there's anything that can be done better.

## Host a Mini-Retrospective

_Retrospectives_ – are quick ten- to fifteen-minute, focused discussions where the team regularly get together and talk about advantages and shortfall.

- What are we doing really well?
- Where can we be doing better?

# Knowing it Works – UNIT TESTING

**No-brainers of agile software engineering:**

1. Unit Testing – to prove that what we built works
2. Refactoring – the art of simplicity and keeping the code clean
3. Test-driven Development (TTD) – for designing and dealing with complexity
4. Continuous Integration – maintaining a state of production readiness

- ## Unit Testing

  _Unit tests_ – are small, method-level tests developers write every time they make a change to the software to prove challenges they made works as expected.

  Whenever in doubt about how our code is going to behave, or we want to verify that it works as expected – we write a unit tests. Unit tests are invaluable beacause once we automate and make them easy to run, we can run them every time we make a change to our codebase.

  **Benefits of writing unit tests:**

      1. They give you instant feedback.
      2. They drammaticatlly lower the cost of regression testing.
      3. They greatly reduce the debug time.
      4. They let you deploy with confidence.

- ## Refactoring

  _Technical Debt_ – is the continuous accumilation of shortcuts, hacks, duplication, and other sins commit against the code bsae in the name of speed and schedule.

  _Agile Refactoring_ – is the way of systematically paying down the technical debt as you go. It is a way of incrermentally improving and maintaining our software's integrity and design that lets us meet he goals of today and be in good position to handle the new set of challenges.

  > _Improve understandability of the code by making it easier to comprehend and more amenable to change (well-named methods and variables)_

  **Refactor Hard – Continuously.**
  Refactoring aggressively means not saving upi all your refactoring unitl the end of iteration. When done right, refactoring is almost invisible.

  If the big refactring falls into the gray area, there are two questions need answer before deciding whether to proceed:
  • Are we near the end of the project?
  • Can it be done incrementally?

- ## Test-Driven Development

_Test-Driven Development (TDD)_ – is a software development technique that uses really short development cycles to incrementally design your software.

**Write Your Test First.**

Here's how it works: Before you write and new code for the system, you first write a failing unit test (design), then you do whatever it takes to make the test pass, then you go back and clean ou any code sins committed while trying to get those unit tests to pass.

> _Rule #1: Don't write any new code unitl you first have a failing test._

> _Rule #2: Test everything that could "possibly" break._

- ## Continuous Integration

  The production start on day one of the project. Agilist like this notion of production readiness beacuse it acknowledges that the software spends a lot more time in production than development, and encourages the idea of making changes to a production-ready system.

  _Continuous Integration_ – is the act of continuously taking changes developers make to their software and integrating them all together continuosly throughout the day.

  **To Set Up Continuous Integration System:**

  - A source code repository
  - A check-in process 1. Get latest source from the repository. 2. Make changes. 3. Run tests. 4. Check for any more updates. 5. Run tests again. 6. Check-in.

  - An automated build

    - Compiles code
    - Runs the tests
    - Deploys

  - A willingness to work in small chunks

> _RESPECT THE BUILD_
